### 3: Managerial Leverage

- What Is a Manager's Output?

  A manager's output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence

- "Daddy, What Do You Really Do?"

	- A manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift his energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of his organization. In other words, he should move to the point where his leverage will be the greatest.

- Leverage of Managerial Activity

  judgments and opinions
  direction
  allocation of resources
  mistakes detected
  personnel trained and subordinates developed
  courses taught
  products planned
  commitments negotiated

### 6: Planning: Today's Acdtions for Tomorrow's Output

- The Planning Process

	- Step 1 - Environmental Demand
	- Step 2 - Present Status
	- Step 3 - What To Do To Close The Gap

		- What do you need to do to close the gap
		- What can you do to close the gap
		- The set of actions you decide upon is your strategy

			- As you formulate in words what you plan to do, the most abstract and general summary of those actions meaningful to you is your strategy
			- What you'll do to implement the strategy is your tactics
			- Frequently, a strategy at one managerial level is the tactical concern of the next higher level

	- Some Examples

- The Output of the Planning Process

	- Today's gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past
	- What do I have to do TODAY to solve - or better, avoid - TOMORROW's problem?
	- The output of the planning process is the DECISIONS made and the ACTIONS taken as a result of the process
	- How far ahead should the planners look?

		- You implement only that portion of a plan that lies within the time window between now and the next time you go through the exercise. Everything else you can look at again. 

Be careful not to plan too frequently, allowing ourselves time to judge the impact of the decisions we made and to determine whether out decisions were on the right track or not.

	- Who should be involved in the planning process? The operating management of the organization.
	- Remember that by saying "yes" -to projects, a course of action, or whatever-you are implicitly saying "no" to something else.

- Management by Objectives (MBO): The Planning Process Applied to Daily Work

	- Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.)
	- How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results.)
	- Upon what time period should an MBO system focus?

		- MBO is largely designed to provide feedback relevant to the specific task at hand.

For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the activity it is measuring occurs.

	- The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus.

		- This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small.

If we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing.

- Two Case Histories

	- The MBO system is meant to pace a person-to put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own performance. It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review, but should be just one input used to determine how well an individual is doing.

## PART III: Team of teams

### 7: The Breakfast Factory Goes National

- Very complicated
- The management is not just a team game, it is a game in which we have to fashion a team of teams, where the various individual teams exist in some suitable and mutually supportive relationship with each other.

### 8: Hybrid Organizations

- Mission-oriented form

  8 Two extreme organization forms.png

- Functional form
- Most are mixed.

Intel's organization form is a hybrid organization. Our hybrid nature comes from the fact that the form of the overall corporate organization results from a mix of the business divisions, which are mission-oriented, and the functional groups.

### 9: Dual Reporting

- Where Should Plant Security Report?

	- 9 Dual Reporting.png
	- Trust in no way relates to an organizational principle
but is instead an aspect of the corporate culture.

Put simply, it is a set of values and beliefs, as well as familiarity with the way things are done and should be done in a company. The point is that a strong and positive corporate culture is absolutely essential if dual reporting and decision-making by peers are to work.

## PART IV: The players

### 11: The Sports Analogy

- The single most important task of a manager is to elicit peak performance from his subordinates.

When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can't do it or won't do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. To determine
which, we can employ a simple mental test: if the person's life depended on doing the work, could he do it? If the answer is yes, that person is not motivated; if the answer is no, he is not capable.

So if two things limit high output, a manager has two ways to tackle the issue: through training and motivation. Each can improve a person's performance.

	- 11 Training and Motivation.png

- Training
- Motivation

	- How does a manager motivate his subordinates? For most of us, the word implies doing something to another person. But I don't think that can happen, because motivation has to come from within somebody. Accordingly, all a manager can do is create an environment in which motivated people can flourish.
	- Abraham Maslow's theory of motivation:

Motivation is closely tied to the idea of needs, which cause people to have drives, which in turn result in motivation.
	- A need once satisfied stops being a need and therefore stops being a source of motivation. Simply put, if we are to create and maintain a high degree of motivation, we must keep some needs unsatisfied at all times.

- Concurrent Needs

	- 11 Concurrent Needs.png

Self-Actualization
Esteem/Recognition
Social/Affiliation
Safety/Security
Physiological

- Money and Task-Relevant Feedback
- Fear
- The Sports Analogy

	- Thus, our role as managers is, first, to train the individuals (to move them along the horizontal axis shown in the illustration on 11 Training and Motivation.png). and, second, to bring them to the point where self-actualization motivates them, because once there, their motivation will be self-sustaining and limitless.

### 12: Task Relevant Maturity

- Some researchers in this field argue that there is a fundamental variable that tells you what the best management style is in a particular situation. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the 
 subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience. Moreover, all this is very specific to the task at hand, and it is
entirely possible for a person or a group of people to have a TRM that is high in one job but low in another.
- The conclusion is that varying management styles are needed as task-relevant maturity varies.

	- 12 Task-Relevant Maturity.png

- But regardless of what the TRM may be, the manager should always monitor a subordinate's work closely enough to avoid surprises. The presence or absence of monitoring, as we've said before, is
the difference between a supervisor's delegating a task and abdicating it.
- The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external.
- Management Style and Managerial Leverage
- It's Not Easy to Be a Good Manager

	- Deciding the TRM of your subordinates is not easy
	- Moreover, even if a manager knows what the TRM is, his personal preferences tend to override the logical and proper choice of management style.
	- Another problem here is a manager's perception of himself. We tend to see ourselves more as communicators and delegators than we really are, certainly much more than do our subordinates.
	- There is a huge distinction between a social relationship and a communicating management style, which is a caring involvement in the work of the subordinate. Close relationships off the job may help to create an equivalent relationship on the job, but they should not be confused.

### 13: Performance Appraisal: Manager as Judge and Jury

- Why Bother?

	- Why do we review the performance of our subordinates?

to assess the subordinate's work
to improve performance
to motivate
to provide feedback to a subordinate
to justify raises
to reward performance
to provide discipline
to provide work direction
to reinforce the company culture
	- The feelings of supervisor and subordinates
	- But what is its fundamental purpose? There is one that is more important than any of the others: it is to improve the subordinate's perfrmance. The review is usually dedicated to two things: first, the skill level of the subordinate, to determine what skills are missing and to find ways to remedy that lack; and second, to intensify the subordinate's motivation in order to get him on a higher performance curve for the same skill level (12 Task-Relevant Maturity.png).

- Assessing Performance

	- To make an assessment less difficult, a supervisor should clarify in his own mind in advance what it is that he expects from a subordinate and then attempt to judge whether he performed to expectations.
	- Let's think back to our concept of the managerial "black box." Using it, we can characterize performance by output measures and internal measures.
	- A similar kind of trade-off also has to be considered here: weighing long-term-oriented against short-termoriented performance.
	- There is also a time factor to consider. The subordinate's output during the review period may have all, some, or nothing to do with his activities during the same period.
	- Finally, as you review a manager, should you be judging his performance or the performance of the group under his supervision? You should be doing both.
	- One big pitfall to be avoided is the "potential trap." At all times you shoulq force yourself to assess performance, not potential. By "potential" I mean form rather than substance.

the performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the one we would accord to his organization! It is very important to assess actual performance, not appearances; real output, not good form.

- Delivering the Assessment

	- There are three L's to keep in mind when delivering a review: Level, listen, and leave yourself out.

		- You must level with your subordinate-the credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank. And don't be surprised to find that praising someone in a straightforward fashion can be just as hard as criticizing him without embarrassment.
		- This is what I mean by listening: employing your entire arsenal of sensory capabilities to make certain your points are being properly interpreted by your subordinate's brain.
		- The third L is "leave yourself out." It is very important for you to understand that the performance review is about and for your subordinate. So your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or whatever should be kept out of it.

	- Most reviews probably fall into this category, containing both positive and negative assessments. Common problems here include superficiality, cliches, and laundry lists of unrelated observations. All of these will leave your subordinate bewildered and will hardly improve his future performance, the review's basic purpose.
	- The key is to recognize that your subordinate, like most people, has only a finite capacity to deal with facts, issues, and suggestions.

How can you target a few key areas?

		- First, consider as many aspects of your subordinate's performance as possible. You should scan material such as progress reports, performance against quarterly objectives, and one-on-one meeting notes. Then sit down with a blank piece of paper. As you consider your subordinate's performance, write everything down on the paper. Do not edit in your head. Get everything down, knowing that doing so doesn't commit you to do anything. Things major, minor, and trivial can be included in no particular order. When you have run out of items, you can put all of your supporting documentation away.
		- Now, from your worksheet, look for relationships between the various items listed.

When you find such relationships, you can start calling them "messages" for the subordinate. At this point, your worksheet might look something like that shown on the image left.

			- 13 Worksheet for performance review.png

		- Now, again from your worksheet, begin to draw conclusions and specific examples to support them.
		- Once your list of messages has been compiled, ask yourself if your subordinate will be able to remember all of the messages you have chosen to deliver. If not, you must delete the less important ones. Remember, what you couldn't include in this review, you can probably take up in the next one.

	- Let's talk about surprises.

When you are using the worksheet, sometimes you come up with a message that will startle you. So what do you do? You're faced with either delivering the message or not, but if the purpose of the review is to improve your subordinate's performance, you must deliver it.

- The Blast

	- With a little soul-searching, you may come to realize that you have a major performance problem on your hands. You have a subordinate who, unless turned around, could get fired. To deal with the problem, you and your subordinate will likely go through stages commonly experienced in problem-solving of all kinds and particularly in conflict resolution.

		- 13 The stages of problem-solving.png

	- A poor performer has a strong tendency to ignore his problem. Here a manager needs facts and examples so that he can demonstrate its reality.

The stages of problem-solving: Ignore > Deny > Blame others > Assume responsibility > Find solution
	- It is the reviewer's job to get the subordinate to move through all of the stages to that of assuming responsibility, though finding the solution should be a shared task. The supervisor should keep track of what stage things are in. If the supervisor wants to go on to find the solution when the subordinate is still denying or blaming others, nothing can happen. Knowing where you are will help you both move through the stages together.
	- In the end, there are three possible outcomes. One, the subordinate accepts your assessment and your recommended cure, and commits himself to take it. Two, he may disagree completely with your assessment but still accepts your cure. Three, the subordinate disagrees with your assessment and does not commit himself to do what you've recommended.
	- Any outcome that includes a
commitment to action is acceptable.

To make things work, people do not need to side with you; you only need them to commit themselves to pursue a course of action that has been decided upon.
	- If it becomes clear that you are not going to get your subordinate past the blame-others stage, you will have to assume the formal role of the supervisor, endowed with position power, and say, "This is what I, as your boss, am instructing you to do. I understand that you do not see it my way. You may be right or I may be right. But I am not only empowered, I am required by the organization for which we both work to give you instructions, and this is what I want you to do . . ." And proceed to secure your subordinate's commitment to the course of action you want and thereafter monitor his performance against that commitment.

- Reviewing the Ace

	- It seems that for an achiever the supervisor's effort goes into determining and justifying the judgment of the superior performance, while giving little attention to how he could do even better. But for a poor performer, the supervisor tends to concentrate heavily on ways he can improve performance, providing detailed and elaborate "corrective action programs," step-by-step affairs meant to ensure that the marginal employee can pull himself up to meet minimum requirements.
	- I think we have our priorities reversed. Shouldn't we spend more time trying to improve the performance of our stars?

- Other Thoughts and Practices

	- Is it a good idea to ask the subordinate to prepare some kind of a self-review before being reviewed by his supervisor?

Reviewing the performance of subordinates is a formal act of leadership. If supervisors permit themselves to be prompted in one way or another, their leadership and their capacity for it will begin to appear false.
	- What about asking your subordinate to evaluate your performance as his supervisor? But you should make it clear to your subordinate that it's yourjob to assess his performance, while his assessment of you has only advisory status. The point is, he is not your leader; you are his. And under no circumstances should you pretend that you and your subordinates are equal during performance reviews.
	- Should you deliver the written review before, during, or after the face-to-face discussion?

In my experience, the best thing to do is to give your subordinate the written review sometime before the face-to-face discussion. He can then read the whole thing privately and digest it. He can react or overreact and then look at the "messages" again. By the time the two of you get together, he will be

### 14: Two Difficult Tasks

- Interviewing a potential employee

	- Conducting The Interview
	- The applicant should do 80 percent of the talking during the interview, and what he talks about should be your main concern. But you have a great deal of control here
by being an active listener.
	- What are the subjects that you should bring up during an interview?

	  - Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your management, especially by the levels above your immediate supervisor.
	  - What are your weaknesses? How are you working to eliminate them?
	  - Convince me why my company should hire you.
	  - What are some of the problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you going about solving them? What could you have done to prevent them from cropping up?
	  - Why do you think you're ready for this new job?
	  - What do you consider your most significant achievements? Why were they important to you?
	  - What do you consider your most significant failures? What did you learn from them?
	  - Why do you think an engineer should be chosen for a marketing position? (Vary this one according to the situation.)
	  - What was the most important course or project you completed in your college career? Why was it so important?

	- The information to be gained here tends to fall into four distinct categories.
Technical/Skills
What He Did With Knowledge
Discrepancies
Operational Values

	  Technical/Skills
	  describe some projects
	  what are your weaknesses
	  
	  What He Did With Knowledge
	  past achievements
	  past failures
	  
	  Discrepancies
	  what did you learn from failures
	  problems in current position
	  
	  Operational Values
	  why are you ready for new job
	  why should my company hire you
	  why should engineer be chosen for marketing
	  most important college course/project

	- You can't get,away from relying on a candidate's selfassessment. But that's not a bad way to get direct answers to direct questions.
	- Asking a candidate to handle a hypothetical situation can also enlighten you.
	- Another approach follows that you may want to use while interviewing. The candidate can tell you a great deal about his capabilities, skills, and values by asking you questions.
	- A final point about references: when you are talking to them, you're really after the same information that you tried to get directly from the candidate.
	- What about "tricks"?

But I think the interview should be completely straightforward.

So show yourself and your environment as they really are.

- Trying to talk a valued employee out of quitting

	- Drop what you are doing. Sit him down and ask him why he is quitting. Let him talk-don't argue about anything with him.
	- Make him talk, because after the prepared points are delivered, the real issues may come out. Don't argue, don't lecture, and don't panic.
	- You have to convey to him by what you do that he is important to you, and you have to find out what is really troubling him. Don't try to change his mind at this point, but buy time.
	- What's your next move? Because you have a major problem, you go to your supervisor for help and advice.
	- You now must vigorously pursue every avenue available to you to keep him with the firm, even if it means transferring him to another department.
	- You may ask why you should put yourself out to keep an employee whom you are going to lose. There is a basic principle involved: you owe it to your employer to save an employee for the company.
	- Now you may be ready to go back to your subordinate with a solution, one that addresses his real reasons for wanting to quit and one that in turn will benefit the company.
	- You now have to make him feel comfortable with the new arrangement. You might say something like, "You did not blackmail us into doing anything we shouldn't have done anyway. When you almost quit, you shook us up and made us aware of the error of our ways. We are just doing what we should have done without any of this happening."

### 15: Compensation as Task-Relevant Feedback

- Money has significance at all levels of Maslow's motivation hierarchy.

food, housing...
a measure of one's worth in a competitive environment
- As a supervisor, you have to be very sensitive toward the various money needs of your subordinates and show empathy toward them. You must be especially careful not to project your own circumstances onto others.
- As managers, our concern is to get a high level of performance from our subordinates. So we want to dispense, allocate, and use money as a way to deliver task-relevant feedback.
- performance bonus

### 16: Why Training is the Boss's Job

- The manager should do the training himself
- For training to be effective, it has to be closely tied to how things are actually done in your organization.
- two different training tasks. The first task is teaching new members of our organization the skills needed to perform their jobs. The second task is teaching new ideas, principles, or skills to the present members of our organization.
- For starters, make a list of the things you feel your subordinates or the members of your department should be trained in. Don't limit the scope of your list. Items should range from what seems simple (training the person who takes calls at the restaurant) to loftier and more general things like the objectives and value systems of your department, your plant, and your company. Ask the people working for you what they feel they need. They are likely to surprise you by telling you of needs you never knew existed.
- Having done this, take an inventory of the managerteachers and instructional materials available to help deliver training on items on your list. Then assign priorities among these items.
- To avoid letting yourself bog down in the difficult task of course preparation, set a schedule for your course, with deadlines, and commit yourself to it. Create an outline for the whole course, develop just the first lecture, and go.
- Develop the second lecture after you have given the first.
